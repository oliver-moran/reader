You can also right click on selected text to open a context menu to speak the text you have highlighted. To stop text that is being read out, just unselect the text by clicking anywhere on the page.

## Preferences

Reader preferences can be set in your preferences by selecting "Extensions & Themes" in Firefox or "Extensions" in Chrome.

* Set your preferred voice and rate of speech. The actual spoken voice will depend on the language of the webpage you are reading.
* Choose to enable or disable the automatic speaking of highlighted text. This can be over-ridden for individual websites clicking the Reader icon.

The keyboard command can be modified through the Firefox and Chrome preferences menu. To reset all preferences to their defaults, click the Reset button in Reader's preferences.

Reader doesn't transmit any data about what you are reading data away from your computer. The speech synthesis is performed locally in your browser.

Your preferences are stored in your synced browser storage, which you can manage in your Firefox and Chrome preferences.
